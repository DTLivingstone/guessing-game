    <h1>My Quiz</h1>
    <h3>The Code</h3>
    <p>I start by asking the user for his or her name in a prompt, then output it to the console. Next I greet the user in an alert and introduce the quiz. I start the quiz by declaring a variable called "score" and setting it to 0. After that I ask the first question in a prompt, then test to see if it's correct and increment score by 1 if it is. I repeat this twice with for the other questions. After this I use an alert to tell the user how many answers they got correct. Finally, I tell the user which answers they got wrong in separate alerts.</p>
