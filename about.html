    <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>My name is David Livingstone, and I was born and raised in New Mexico. I graduated with a degree in Journalism and Mass Communication from New Mexico State University, then I moved to the Puget Sound shortly after. I had been working for an online retailer for a few years, but I left that job to enroll in Code Fellows and take my career in a more technical direction. Outside of school and work, I like checking out coffee shops, reading technology and design blogs, and cooking. I'm also a runner, and I ran the Seattle Half Marathon this past Sunday.</p>
