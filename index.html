    <h1>My Quiz</h1>
    <h3>The Code</h3>
    <p>I start by asking the user for his or her name in a prompt, then output it to the console. Next I greet the user in an alert and introduce the quiz. I start the quiz by declaring a variable called "score" and setting it to 0. After that I ask the first question in a prompt, then test to see if it's correct and increment score by 1 if it is. I repeat this twice with for the other questions. After this I use an alert to tell the user how many answers they got correct. Finally, I tell the user which answers they got wrong in separate alerts.</p>
    <h3>More About Me</h3>
    <p>My name is David Livingstone, and I was born and raised in New Mexico. I graduated with a degree in Journalism and Mass Communication from New Mexico State University, then I moved to the Puget Sound. I'd been working for an online retailer for a few years, but I left that job to enroll in Code Fellows and build on my technical skills. Outside of school and work, I like checking out coffee shops, running, reading about design, and cooking.</p>

      var user = prompt('What is your name?');
      console.log('user goes by: ' + user);
      alert('Nice to meet you ' + user + ', here\'s a short quiz about me. Please respond with a lowercase "yes" or "no."');
      var score = 0;
      var ans1 = prompt('Was I born in New Mexico?');
      if (ans1 == 'yes') {score++ ;}
      var ans2 = prompt('Do I like Starbucks?');
      if (ans2 == 'no') {score++ ;}
      var ans3 = prompt('Do I have any pets?');
      if (ans3 == 'no') {score++ ;}
      alert('You got ' + score + ' answers correct.');
      if (ans1 == 'no') {alert('You said that I was not born in New Mexico. That\'s incorrect. I was born in Albuquerque, NM.');}
      if (ans2 == 'yes') {alert('You said that I like Starbucks. That\'s incorrect. Herkimer is way better.');}
      if (ans3 == 'yes') {alert('You said that I have pets. That\'s incorrect, but I wish I had a cat.');}
