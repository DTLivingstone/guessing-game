    <h1>My Quiz</h1>
    <h3>The Code</h3>
    <p>I start by asking the user for his or her name in a prompt, then output it to the console. Next I greet the user in an alert and introduce the quiz. I start the quiz by declaring a variable called "score" and setting it to 0. After that I ask the first question in a prompt, then test to see if it's correct and increment score by 1 if it is. I repeat this twice with for the other questions. After this I use an alert to tell the user how many answers they got correct. Finally, I tell the user which answers they got wrong in separate alerts.</p>
    <h3>More About Me</h3>
    <p>My name is David Livingstone, and I was born and raised in New Mexico. I graduated with a degree in Journalism and Mass Communication from New Mexico State University, then I moved to the Puget Sound. I'd been working for an online retailer for a few years, but I left that job to enroll in Code Fellows and build on my technical skills. Outside of school and work, I like checking out coffee shops, running, reading about design, and cooking.</p>
