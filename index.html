    <h3>The Code</h3>
    <p>In this latest version, I've created a function for each unique type of question. I can then create different questions by calling the relevant function and passing necessary information to it, including the question, the answer, and how to respond when the user is correct or wrong. These functions also need a question number, qNumber, passed to them so they can modify the right section of the html.</p>
